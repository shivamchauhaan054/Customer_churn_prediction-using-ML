# Customer_churn_prediction-using-ML
"Customer churn prediction using machine learning is a process where historical customer data is analyzed through algorithms to predict the likelihood of a customer discontinuing their service with a company, enabling businesses to proactively identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies to minimize churn and maximize customer lifetime value.". 
KEY POINTS -
1.Data-driven approach:
Leverages customer data like usage patterns, demographics, purchase history, and interaction details to identify patterns that indicate potential churn. 
2.Supervised learning models:
Typically uses classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines to predict whether a customer will churn or not. 
3.Feature engineering:
Important step to extract relevant features from raw data that contribute most to churn prediction. 
4.Proactive customer retention:
By identifying high-risk customers, businesses can take targeted actions like personalized offers, improved customer support, or loyalty programs to prevent churn.
